							<p>Genshin Impact is an open-world adventure game that features different areas around the fantasy map of Teyvat. In this game,
							you start as a traveller in search for your missing sibling. Throughout the adventure, you run into archons, explorers,
							and other characters which have different powers depending on their vision. These visions may be cryo, pyro, hydro, dendro,
							electro, anemo, and geo. During your adventure, you will come across enemies you need to defeat. All while doing this, you are
							able to wish for different playable characters in the game each having their own story and level up and ascend them. </p>
